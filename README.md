# PlanetsImitation
This project is just a simple imitation of polygons rotating around each other (with no physics, just geometry) with help of OpenGL.
## Position.hpp
Header only. Contains class Position2D with only two floats (x and y) amd method to rotate this position around other position. Needed for RegularPoly class.
## RegularPoly.hh and RegularPoly.cpp
Contains class RegularPoly which have positions of this poly, indices to be passed to OpenGL and bunch of methods.
## main.cpp
Example of usage.
